Hi, here is the resource sharing for Research on Second-Use Batteries. 

A. 'dcac' is unfinished, which means the code needs modification.

The 'files' directory under 'dcac' contains part of files in 'files'(the finished part files) for simplicity and easy use.

B. The other two parts are finished. 

"files" are related complete MATLAB files. "data" are related to MATLAB data for and from simulation.

C. In finished part, three files are important:

1. `LSV_PPP.m`
2. `LSV_PPP2.m`
3. `main.m`

The `LSV_PPP.m` file handles with one-layer LSV-PPP(virtual bus - partial power processing)

`LSV_PPP2.m` is to deal with two-layer LSV-PPP architecture.

The content of `LSV_PPP2.m` is very similar to `LSV_PPP.m`. 

The content of `main.m` is also similar to the previous files. This file serves as a primary entry point for setting up and running simulations that involve battery systems.

D. The slides is a brief summary of finished research(LSV-PPP).
